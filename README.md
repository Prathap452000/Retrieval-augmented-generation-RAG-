# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Conversational AI  

This repository contains an implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Conversational AI**, designed to enhance chatbot responses with external knowledge. The system retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and integrates it with a language model's responses, improving accuracy and contextual relevance.  

## 🔥 Features  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Responses** – Enhances chatbot replies using external knowledge sources.  
- **Conversational Memory** – Maintains context across multiple user interactions.  
- **Vector Database Integration** – Uses Pinecone for fast and efficient retrieval.  
- **OpenAI GPT Integration** – Generates responses based on retrieved knowledge.  
- **Fully Open-Source** – Uses publicly available datasets and APIs.
